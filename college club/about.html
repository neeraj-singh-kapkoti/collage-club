                About This Club
            </h2>
            <p >
                After spending quite some time at this college, we've discovered that there are very few coding and
                development-related activities.
                In addition, there is a severe absence of productive interaction between the seniors and juniors.

                There is also no environment here to foster activities that should ideally be a part of the Computer
                Science students' daily routine.

                As a result, we believe it is critical to provide an environment in which students may learn, develop,
                and explore new ideas together. Hence, we decided to start a coding club so that students with talent
                can participate in such activities while simultaneously encouraging a culture of collective development.

                Right now, we are quite excited and have a lot of plans for the club; for example, we plan to construct
                a few websites, host hackathons, hold coding competitions, and so on (all of this is contingent on the
                participation of members).
                To be honest, everything is still in beta, and we're just trying something new. Depending on how well it
                goes, we'll keep doing it.

                All things considered, we have everyone's best interests at heart.
                If you share our sentiments and want things to change for the better, we invite you to join us in this
                group.
                <h3>Note:</h3>
                We're still in the early stages, so we'll need some volunteers to help with some key club
                responsibilities.
                If you are interested, please fill out the <a href="register.html">registration form</a> .

                <h3>Eligibility:</h3>
